# Automated Onboarding 
The automated onboarding project is built using Azure Logic Apps with Microsoft Entra ID connectors.
The Logic application workflow will receive a HTTP request from onboarding user platforms, extract user information, create the accounts of onboarding users, and send an email to administrators that new users has been created.
